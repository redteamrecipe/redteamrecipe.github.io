URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ping6.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/ping6.py)**

Description:
This Python script allows pinging IPv6 hosts using ICMPv6 echo requests and replies. It creates raw ICMPv6 sockets which requires admin privileges. After creating the raw sockets, it can then send ICMPv6 echo request packets to the target IPv6 hosts and listen for ICMPv6 echo reply packets back. Based on the replies, it calculates and prints out statistics showing how long it takes to receive replies from the target. This allows basic IPv6 network connectivity testing by leveraging raw ICMPv6 socket communication.

## psexec

Techniques used:

- PSEXEC - uses Windows sysinternals psexec functionality
- SMB connections - communicates with the target using SMB
- Command execution - executes commands on the remote host
- Lateral movement - gains access to remote machines on a network

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/psexec.py)**

Description:

This Python script utilizes Windows sysinternals psexec to execute commands on remote Windows machines through SMB connections. It allows passing usernames and passwords/hashes to authenticate and connect to the remote host's C$ admin share through SMB. From there is uses the psexec functionality to copy and execute commands in the context of the user on the remote host. This allows lateral movement and command execution on other machines with valid credentials. It also supports passing hash values if credentials are captured. The script handles all the SMB communication and authentication to leverage the Windows psexec methods for executing processes on other machines on the network.

## raiseChild

Techniques used:

- Process control - injects code into a new child process
- Code injection - injects DLL into subprocess memory space
- Privilege escalation - elevates privileges by injecting into parent process

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/raiseChild.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/raiseChild.py)**

Description:
This Python script allows spawning new processes and injecting arbitrary DLLs into their memory. It leverages the Windows API to create a new suspended child process of the parent python.exe process. It then writes the bytes of the specified DLL into the new process's memory space. Finally, it resumes execution which causes the DLL to execute within the child process. By spawning from the parent Python process it inherits the parent's level of privileges, allowing escalation.

## rbcd

Techniques used:

- DLL injection - injects DLL into lsass.exe process
- Credential dumping - dumps credentials from memory with injected DLL
- LSASS access - leverages access to LSASS process to steal creds

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/rbcd.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/rbcd.py)**

Description:
This Python script provides the capability to perform credential dumping by injecting a DLL into the lsass.exe process. It leverages access to lsass in order to load a custom RBC DLL which can then access memory and dump credentials. The script uses Windows API calls to open the lsass process, allocate memory, write the encoded DLL, and create a remote thread to call it. This gives execution inside lsass, allowing the DLL to extract credentials from memory. These credentials can then be used for lateral movement, pivoting, and escalation.

## rdp_check

Techniques used:

- RDP Protocol - Connects via RDP protocol
- Brute force - Tries credentials against target RDP services
- Remote Desktop - Tests connectivity and login to RDP services

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/rdp_check.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/rdp_check.py)**

Description:
This Python script tests RDP services for valid account credentials. It takes a target, username file, password file and optional domain and attempts to connect to the target's RDP service using found account/password combinations. For each user/pass pair found in the files, it tries to authenticate to verify a valid combination. If successful, it returns that the credentials are valid for RDP access to that target. This allows quickly brute forcing and checking remote desktop credentials.

## rpcdump

Techniques used:

- RPC inspection - Extracts info from RPC services
- SMB client - Connects to target RPC services over SMB
- Discovery - Enumerates and gathers data for recon

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/rpcdump.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/rpcdump.py)**

Description:
This Python script dumps information from remote RPC services by connecting over SMB. It extracts details from the RPC backend that can be used for reconnaissance and discovery. By passing target host details and optional credentials, rpcdump.py communicates with the RPCSS service to enumerate available RPC endpoints. It then probes and dumps information about the RPC backends such as UUIDs, annotated UUIDs, protocol sequences, and supported transfers. This reveals system info and can identify potential lateral movement attacks.

## samrdump

Techniques used:

- SAMR access - Queries SAMR for user info
- Hash dumping - Extracts NT and LM hashes from SAMR
- SMB client - Connects to target over SMB
- Credential access - Retrieves hashes for cracking

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/samrdump.py)**

Description:

This Python script extracts user account details and password hashes from the Security Account Manager Remote (SAMR) service. It connects to the target over SMB and then queries the SAMR functions to enumerate users and extract their NT and LM hashes. By default it will extract hashes for all accessible users, or can dump just a single specified user's hashes. The hashes can then be cracked to attain account passwords for lateral movement and privilege escalation.

## **smbclient**

Techniques used:

- SMB client - connects to SMB shares as a client
- File access - access, copy, delete remote files over SMB
- Lateral movement - pivot through SMB shares
- Discovery - enumerate SMB shares/files

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbclient.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbclient.py)**

Description:
smbclient.py provides SMB client functionality to interact with remote SMB shares and files. It connects to target Windows SMB servers using valid credentials or anonymously. It can then list shares, enumerate directories, upload/download files from the remote server. It provides an interface similar to an smbclient shell allowing file manipulation and discovery. Since itpivot through file shares using stolen credentials or via anonymous access.

## smbexec

Techniques used:

- Command execution - executes commands over SMB
- SMB client - connects to target's ADMIN$ share
- Lateral movement - access other systems on the network

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbexec.py)**

Description:
This Python script executes commands on remote Windows hosts utilizing SMB connections. It connects to the remote admin share (ADMIN$) over SMB using valid credentials. It then creates a service on the remote host via the Service Control Manager. That service is started by the script pointing to cmd.exe with any specified commands. Output from cmd is returned over SMB and printed/saved. This allows execution of arbitrary OS commands on remote hosts the valid credentials have access to.

## smbpasswd

Techniques used:

- SMB client - Connects to target over SMB
- SAMR access - Queries SAMR to change passwords
- Credential access - Changes account passwords

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbpasswd.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbpasswd.py)**

Description:
This Python script allows changing local account passwords on remote machines over SMB by accessing the SAMR database. It takes target details and authenticates over SMB to connect to the remote SAMR service. User credentials and a new password are provided to reset and update the passwords in the SAM database for those accounts. This results in the account passwords being updated without needing local access on the Windows machine.

## smbrelayx

Techniques used:

- SMB relay - Intercepts SMB auth and relays to hit target
- NTLM relay - Captures NTLM messages and replays them
- Credential theft - Steals NTLM hashes passing by
- Privilege escalation - Abuses relayed creds for escalation

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbrelayx.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbrelayx.py)**

Description:
smbrelayx.py performs SMB and NTLM authentication relay attacks by intercepting authentication attempts and relaying them to access other resources. It listens for incoming SMB connection attempts that contain NTLM messages. It captures challenge/response NTLM info and uses it to connect and authenticate to other servers that the user has access to. This could give elevated access by abusing relayed credentials. It can also capture NTLM hashes over these connections through manipulation of the SMB/NTLM traffic that it controls.

## smbserver

Techniques used:

- SMB server - Implements an SMB server
- File sharing - Shares folders over SMB
- Credential capture - Logs authentication attempts
- Proxy - Man in the middle SMB connections

URL: **[https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/smbserver.py)**

Description:

smbserver.py sets up a fake SMB server that can capture credentials and interact with Windows SMB client connections. It implements the SMB protocol to simulate an SMB share that clients can connect to. It allows sharing a local folder over SMB when clients connect. The server logs all authentication attempts and file activity. This allows man-in-the-middle attacks to intercept legit SMB connections by running as a proxy, capturing SMB credentials in the process.
